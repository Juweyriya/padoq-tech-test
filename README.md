# Padoq - Technical Test

Thank you for agreeing to undertake a short technical test for Padoq.  We would like you to look at the code here and do as many of the following things you can in 2 hours maximum.  this isn't about "achieving the result in two hours" but about simply putting a reasonable time limit to ensure that we don't ask for too much of your time to assess this task.

* Write a small EXPLAIN.md file that explains what is happening here
* Modify the code so that the components are in separate files
* Modify the components so that they are function based components
* Write tests for the new setup

We aren't looking for perfection - the main aim is that we get to understand how you handle code understanding, code refactoring, and testing.

The most important part of this for us would be that you are able to understand code, refactor it and write function based components for react that are testable.

once you have completed as much of this as possible in two hours, we would really value a file called NEXTSTEPS.md that explains

* How you approached the test
* What you would do differently if you took the test again
* Improvements to the application you can suggest that could be implemented, and an estimation of how much time they would take.

Again we're not looking for perfection in this, it's to assist in capturing your thought process.  W
