### How i approached the task

For this task i started by reading the instructions and noting down the tasks i should attempt in the 2 hours. I then did NPM i and started the app. I then looked at the complied app alongside the code & file structure.

- From looking at the app js file i could see all the 3 components (Todo, Todos & AddTodo) were in one file
- i understood that the Todos component showed the list of todos
- the AddTodo added a todo to the list
- The Todo component shows a single todo

i separated the components and made a components folder. I then exported and imported the components. During this i also imported the Todo and AddTodo components into the Todos.js file.

### What would i do differently

- One ting i would have done differently would be to try to move one components at a time, and when the first one worked i would have used that logic with the two other components. I think this would have allowed me to spot my errors more quickly.

- This would maybe have provided me more time and i would have had a chance to attempt the rest if the task. If i had time for the testing i would have tried to write a unit test using Jest.

- following this i would have spent the remaining time trying to change the CSS.

### Improvements

- To implement a scrolling effect that would move the todo list up and down when when selected
- To implement a selection of colour labels to show importance of Todo
- Add a button which clears the whole todo list
- Show the date and time the to do was added/ when its due
- Improve the css

Overall i think some of these improvements would take longer than others depending on whether a ui library was used and the level of experience of the developer. For this reason i would say approx. 1-2 days.
